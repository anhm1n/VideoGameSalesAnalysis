# Video Games Sales Analysis
## What is this?
This project folder serves to show some of the code and dataset for the final group project for STAT 423. The project folder is incomplete in terms of the R code files because the project was wrapped up on a laptop that did not push to GitHub. However, our final PowerPoint presentation is available for viewing

## What did I contribute?
I contributed coding, discussion, and presentation for this project. We worked very well as a team, so it's hard to determine where I helped exactly because we all gave input for each section. I acknowledge that the PowerPoint may be a little over the top, but I love pictures and colors because as a student, it's what keeps me engaged in class.  

## What did I learn?
I learned about discrete boundaries. In one of our linear regression assumptions checks, we see the residuals have an unusual behavior as the residuals do not go under this diagonal line. I also learned more about the consequences of being knowledgeable about the domain we are working in. This is extremely important because it is what leads one to make certain decisions during the data manipulation process. For example, it could be argued that we filtered too many Nintendo games out.
